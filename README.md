# React-todoMVC vs Redux-todoMVC

It seemed that http://todomvc.com/ didn't have a good react example.

The only one I [saw](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react) used ES5

I refactored the [redux example]( https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) to just use react with ES6
