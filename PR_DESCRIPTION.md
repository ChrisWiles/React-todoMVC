## Changes Made

- Updated ReactDOM.render to use createRoot to comply with React 18.
- Corrected the autoFocus attribute in TodoTextInput.js to use a boolean value instead of a string.
- Updated PropTypes imports across all components to use the 'prop-types' package.

These changes address deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with the latest version of React.
